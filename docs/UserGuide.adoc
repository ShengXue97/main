== Welcome to CodeCampX
Code Camp X (CCX) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app to manage the administrative tasks of running a coding camp*.
More importantly, CCX is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, CCX can allow you to manage your camp's administrative tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.
Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

=== Legend
The following *3* callouts will be used throughout the documentation which you may wish to pay attention to as it may
contain important details:

[NOTE]
Just for your info, do not be alarmed. Be sure to read these notes as it might contain some important information.

can be safely ignored.

[WARNING]
Some things might go wrong if you are not careful, or did not follow the instructions correctly. You are strongly
advised to read whatever is in this block.

[[Components]]
== Components
*CodeCampX* consists of five core components: Students, Teachers, Courses, Finances, Assignments

=== Students
You can manage the students by assigning them to courses, and ensuring that they have paid for their courses.

=== Teachers
You can manage the teachers by providing information such as the phone number and email address.
This is critical as teachers are the main point of contact during an emergency. You can keep track
of which teachers you have paid for teaching a course.

=== Courses
You can keep track of the ongoing courses in your Coding Camp. Each course will have an assigned teacher,
as well as a list of assigned students. The course fee should also be specified.

=== Finances
The built-in Sales Management component in CodeCampX provides you with the tools you will need to keep track of financial
records efficiently. Several analytical features are also incorporated to assist you in financial decision-making
and devising marketing strategies.

=== Assignments
You can keep track of the available assignments of the various students or courses through this functionality.

[[Features]]
== Key Features
=== Convenience
*CodeCampX* is an integrated application that will provide you with the utmost convenience and tools you will need to
manage your Coding Camps. It allows you to:

* Export data to `.json` (default) or Excel file `[coming in v2.0]`.

=== Security
We understand that digital security is your biggest concern. *CodeCampX* is capable of securing your restaurants' data by:

* Encrypting all data using state of the art encryption scheme `[coming in v2.0]`.
* Providing accountability through logging of system events.

=== Efficiency
Time is money. *CodeCampX* ensures that the application will:

* Load within 5 seconds.
* Execute commands within split of a second and update the GUI almost instantaneously.

[[Commands]]
== Commands
*CodeCampX* is jam-packed with features and it may be daunting for new users. The subsequent sections of the user guide
provides a step by step walk-through of all the commands *CodeCampX* has to offer.

Do read our short explanation about Command Format below so that the subsequent portions of this section will make sense to you.
====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add-student n/STUDENT_NAME`, `STUDENT_NAME` is a
parameter which can be used as `add-student n/Bob`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/STUDENT_NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Bob t/loyal` or as `n/Bob`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as
`{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/loyal`, `t/10years t/new` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `cid/COURSE_ID tid/TEACHER_ID`, `tid/TEACHER_ID cid/COURSE_ID`
is also acceptable.
